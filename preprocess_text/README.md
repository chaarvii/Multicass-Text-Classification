#Text Preprocessing  

Unstructured text data is not comprehended by the machine learning algorithms and thus there is a need to clean and preprocess the data so that it can be used efficiently various NLP algorithms. Sometimes unstructured text data contains noise that needs to be treated as well. This module standardises the text data thus making it ready for training. 

The module has been made flexible keeping in mind the wide array of NLP tasks.
